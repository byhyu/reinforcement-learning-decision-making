            Class constructor. Creates a Deep Neural Network using Keras (frontend) and TensorFlow
            (backend). In case file_name is present, then the model is loaded from the given file.
        
    Public Methods:
        train(X instances data, Y instances labels): returns none
            Trains the Deep NN model.
